# Real-Time-Drowsiness-Detection
Built a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using YOLOv5 for robust eye and face detection. Used OpenCV for live video capture and PyTorch-based YOLOv5 inference for classifying eye states.  Implemented drowsiness alerts using detection confidence thresholds and continuous frame analysis.
